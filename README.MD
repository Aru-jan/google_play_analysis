Slytherin Team: Aru, Bluce, Emmanuel, Martha, Supriya<br>

Project Overview:<br>
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of apps available on the Google Play Store. It includes a detailed examination of app categories, an in-depth analysis of the most reviewed apps, and a sentiment analysis of reviews for the most installed apps.<br>

Dataset Description:<br>
The data was obtained by merging two datasets sourced from Kaggle. The combined dataset includes key features such as app name, category, number of installs, size, reviews, ratings, and more.<br>

Objective:<br>
The primary goal of this analysis is to uncover valuable insights from the Play Store apps data, which can empower app developers to succeed in the highly competitive Android market.<br> The findings are intended to provide actionable strategies to help developers optimize their apps, capture user attention, and improve overall performance.<br>

Data Cleaning:<br>
Data cleaning was an essential first step in this project. It involved addressing messy data, such as handling emojis and multiple languages, formatting numerical values correctly, and removing irrelevant entries before merging the datasets. This process ensured the data was suitable for analysis.<br>

Analysis Approach:<br>
After cleaning the data, it was imported into SQL for structured querying. The SQL queries yielded tables that were used in combination with Pandas for data visualization, allowing for deeper insights into trends, app performance, and user preferences.<br>

Key Results:<br>
Most Popular Categories: The categories with the highest number of installs are Games, Communication, and Productivity, reflecting the diverse interests of Play Store users.<br>
Top Apps: Subway Surfers, Instagram, and Google Drive rank as the most installed apps, dominating their respective categories.<br>
Games Category Dominance: Games lead not only in the number of installs but also in average ratings and total reviews. Additionally, the Games category has the broadest content rating, making it accessible to users of all ages, from kids to adults.<br>
Positive Review Sentiment: The most installed apps tend to receive positive sentiment in user reviews, indicating strong user satisfaction across these popular apps.<br>
